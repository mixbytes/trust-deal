## dev-notes
1. reviewer can be got from ReviewerAcceptedConditions 
2. think about functions that definitely must emit events
14. move all events, that are used in front, to interface

Run tests with:
```
npx truffle test

# with events
npx truffle test --show-events
```

Make sure you have npx package.
